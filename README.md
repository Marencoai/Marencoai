# About me
Hey there! Iâ€™m Diana Marencoâ€”a Salesforce-certified operations strategist turned full-stack CRM builder. My background? I launched a fintech startup as Director of Operations, where I led a 14-person team, built systems from scratch, and learned what real operational chaos looks like.

Iâ€™ve configured CRMs inside outâ€”across Salesforce, zoho, and proprietary MCA platforms. I know what breaks, what overwhelms users, and what gets left behind. Now Iâ€™m writing my own story by building a system that actually works for humans especially in high-stakes industries like affordable housing.

ðŸ§  The Mission

CRMs shouldnâ€™t make life harder, they should feel intuitive, supportive, and even a little bit magical. So I built a modular CRM from the ground up using Supabase, React, and Vercel, supported by AI assistants like Lovable and ChatGPT. The goal? Replace the duct tape with something elegant and scalable.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
	â€¢	Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
	â€¢	Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
	â€¢	Hosting: Vercel
	â€¢	AI Assistant: Lovable AI (code generation), ChatGPT (QA & planning)
	â€¢	Dev Tools: Cursor (local dev + version control), GitHub

ðŸš€ What It Does

This CRM manages affordable housing project lifecycles from lead â†’ application â†’ funding â†’ compliance. It includes:
	â€¢	Full project and application management
	â€¢	Custom task engine (with Kanban and Gantt views)
	â€¢	Supabase-based document upload system
	â€¢	SharePoint backup integration (scaffolded)
	â€¢	Client, team, and funding source tracking
	â€¢	Timeline and milestone planning
	â€¢	UI built for clarity and emotional intelligence

ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Learning
	â€¢	Building features in Cursor with direct code control
	â€¢	Connecting AI agents into practical workflows
	â€¢	Managing version control through GitHub
	â€¢	Debugging and QA testing without losing my mind
	â€¢	Thinking like a dev and a product manager

ðŸ‘€ Whatâ€™s Next
	â€¢	Replacing SharePoint dependency with smarter in-app document flows
	â€¢	Launching a Life CRM based on this same engine
	â€¢	Experimenting with AI agents to reduce tedious data entry
	â€¢	Open-sourcing modules for freelance use

ðŸ”¥ Why Should I care?

This isnâ€™t just a side projectâ€”itâ€™s a production-quality system thatâ€™s already in client use. Iâ€™ve been underpaid for this work, but I see it as my launchpad to higher-impact builds, better clients, and my next big chapter in tech.
